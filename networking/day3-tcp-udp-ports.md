\# Day 3 – TCP, UDP \& Ports



\## What I Learned

\- TCP vs UDP

\- 3-way handshake

\- Common ports (22, 80, 443, 53, 3389)



\## Commands Practiced

netstat -ano

ss -tulnp

nmap -sT 127.0.0.1



\## Security Perspective

\- TCP is reliable → used in HTTP, SSH

\- UDP is fast → DNS, streaming

\- Open ports = attack surface



\## Key Takeaway

Understanding ports and protocols is critical for SOC alert analysis.
